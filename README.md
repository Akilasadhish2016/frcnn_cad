### OsiriX/Horos plugin

I wrote a plugin for the popular medical image viewer: OsiriX/Horos. This is a simplified version of the model. It is based on CoreML. In order to run it you will need:
- A mac
- High Sierra (10.13) operating system ( becase of CoreML )
- OsiriX/Horos medical image viewer.

Just download the plugin, unzip it, click on the installer, and approve it. Restart OsiriX/Horos. The plugin will appear in the menu of OsiriX/Horos: Plugins/Image Filters/CnnCAD. You can also add it to the toolbar of the 2D viewer.

Note: Now the plugin only works correctly with Horos!

The OsiriX/Horos can be downloaded from here.  The plugin is licensed with Creative Commons Attribution + Noncommercial + ShareAlike license [![License: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC%20BY--NC--SA%204.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)
